    <h2>The Legend of George Crum</h2>
    <p>George Crum was a cook, born July 15th, 1824. He was originally named George Speck, but later adopted the name of Crum because it was the name his father used in his career as a jockey. In the summer of '53, he started working as a chef at the Saratoga Springs' Moon Lake Lodge resort. French fried potatoes were a menu favorite there, and George prepared them frequently. The details on what happened next are somewhat fuzzy, but according to the story that has been passed down, Crum had a customer that claimed his potatoes were cut way too thick.</p>
