    <h2>The Legend of George Crum</h2>
    <p>George Crum was a cook, born July 15th, 1824. He was originally named George Speck, but later adopted the name of Crum because it was the name his father used in his career as a jockey. In the summer of '53, he started working as a chef at the Saratoga Springs' Moon Lake Lodge resort. French fried potatoes were a menu favorite there, and George prepared them frequently. The details on what happened next are somewhat fuzzy, but according to the story that has been passed down, Crum had a customer that claimed his potatoes were cut way too thick. Out of spite, he cut the potatoes as thin as he could and then deep dried them. And in response... they loved it! He began to make them frequently at the resturant and the customers loved them. With the success, he soon opened up his own resturant called "Crumbs House." They had a basket of his signiture chips on every table.</p>

    <h2>Continuing the Legacy</h2>
    <p>These chips were a hit, but Crum sadly nver patented his creation. In 1895, five years after Crum closed his resturant, a man named William Tappenden made potato chips and sold them at a local grocery store. Soon, other companies followed suit. In 1926, the idea of putting chips into wax paper bags was created by Laura Scudder. In 1932, Herman Lay founded Lay's, which has become an enormous, nationally marketed, powerhouse of a company. Crum's little mishap spiraled into an entire industry, which managed to accumulate over 10 billion dollars in 2023.</p>
